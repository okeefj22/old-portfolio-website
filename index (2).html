                <p>I am 20 year old Software Developer living in Dublin. I'm currently working with SAP in Citywest as part of a two year cooperative internship with the company. My work will be primarily focused on the SAP HANA database and its accompanying business suite. I am also currently a registered tutor with UniTuition where I provide grinds in a number of CA1 modules. I was also employed by DCU as a programming lab tutor for first years throughout my second year in the University.</p>
                <p>I have experience using many different programming languages; java, c++, python, x86 assembly, MIPS assembly, R and prolog, having completed numerous University assignments with each.</p>

                    <p>In my spare time I like to play around with new languages, tools and frameworks. I tend to learn by doing so when I'm trying to learn a new language I try to solve Project Euler problems in the new language.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently immersed in Android Development. I have completed Google's 10 week 'Developing Android Apps' course on <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853">Udacity</a> and I'm now developing my own application for personal use. Learning Android development is something I've really been enjoying and it's made me lean towards choosing to develop an Android app for my 3rd year project in University.</p>

                    <h2>Standardise</h2>
                    <p>I always seem to end up with files in my system which follow different naming conventions, whether it be 'foo bar.*', 'foo_bar.*' or my preferred 'foo-bar.*'. Worse again is when upper case letters are thrown into the mix. Seeing as I primarily use a BASH terminal for file operations, naming conventions are quite important to me.</p>
                    <p>BASH is case sensitive and hitting the shift key requires effort so I prefer to have all my file names lower case. This is also my reasoning behind choosing hyphens as opposed to underscores for filenames. To solve my problem, I wrote a simple Python script to change filenames in a specified directory to my preferred file type.  then moved to my bin directory to allow me to call it system wide.</p>
                    <p>Here is the code:</p>

                        import os
                        import sys

                        work_dir = sys.argv[1]
                        files = os.listdir(work_dir)

                        for filename in files:
                            new_filename = filename.replace(' ', '-').replace('_', '-')
                            os.rename(
                                os.path.join(work_dir, filename),
                                    os.path.join(work_dir, new_filename.lower()))

                    <p>Here are some example of it in use:</p>
                    <p>It's a simple script which did a job I needed it to do. It doesn't ask the user for confirmation and there is no exception handling. With a little bit of refactoring the program could...</p>
