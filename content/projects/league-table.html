                    <h2>League Table Generator (In Progress)</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the year in college, my roommates and I would play a few games of FIFA a week. We wanted an easy way keep track of our results, and most importantly, to see who had the most points on average. The best solution we found was an excel sheet where you enter your results and it generates a league table from them. This involved a workaround of placing the excel sheet in a shared Google Drive folder where any of us could edit it. Editing an excel sheet on your phone isn't exactly ideal so I looked to come up with a better solution. I immediately thought of storing the results in a database and generating the table using JOINs on various SELECT statements. I spent a few hours designing my database and trying to normalise it. I decided that the table could be generated from one very simple table containing only the player names and their scores (and an id as a primary key).</p>
                    <p>Below is the database design:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    CREATE TABLE Fixtures (
        Match_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        Player_1 TEXT,
        Score_1 INTEGER,
        Player_2 TEXT,
        Score_2 INTEGER
    );

</pre>
                    <p>And here is the SELECT statment:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    
    SELECT X.Name AS Name, P, W, D, L, F, A, (F - A) AS GD, ((W * 3) + D) AS Pts,  ROUND((((W * 3.0) + D) / P),2) AS Avg
    FROM ((SELECT Name, SUM(For) AS F
          FROM (SELECT Player_2 AS Name, SUM(Score_2) AS For
                FROM Fixtures
                GROUP BY Name
                UNION ALL
                SELECT Player_1 AS Name, SUM(Score_1) AS For
                FROM Fixtures
                GROUP BY Name)
          GROUP BY Name) AS a LEFT JOIN
         ((SELECT Name, SUM(Against) AS A

                    <p>I'm sure the SELECT statement can be optimised and I will look into how to go about this.</p>
                    <p>I'm going to integrate this into an Android application which is why I wrote it in SQLite.</p>
